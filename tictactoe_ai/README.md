# **Tic Tac Toe Web App with AI**

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js for the frontend and Flask with Socket.IO for the backend. The game allows players to:
- Play with a friend locally.
- Play against an AI powered by Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## **Features**
- **Play with a Friend**: Two players can play on the same device.
- **Play with AI**: Play against a challenging AI that uses the Minimax algorithm for decision-making.
- **Undo Functionality**: Each player can undo one move per turn.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Moves and game states are synchronized using Socket.IO.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) for the frontend.
- **Python** (3.8 or higher) for the backend.
- **Flask** and **Socket.IO** for server-side communication.

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-webapp.git
cd tic-tac-toe-webapp
```

### **3. Install Frontend Dependencies**
Navigate to the `src` directory and install the required Node.js packages:
```bash
cd src
npm install
```

### **4. Set Up the Backend**
Navigate to the `python_engine` directory (or wherever `ai_engine.py` is located) and create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
cd python_engine
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Running the Application**

### **1. Start the Backend**
Run the Flask backend server:
```bash
python ai_engine.py
```
By default, the server will start at `http://localhost:4000`.

### **2. Start the Frontend**
Navigate back to the `src` folder and run:
```bash
npm start
```
The React app will start on `http://localhost:3000` and connect to the backend server.

## **How to Play**

### **1. Select a Game Mode**
- **Play with AI**: Compete against the AI, which plays as 'O'.
- **Play with a Friend**: Play locally with another person.

### **2. Make Your Moves**
- Click on a cell to make a move.
- Alternate turns between 'X' and 'O'.

### **3. Undo**
- Each player can undo their most recent move.

### **4. Win the Game**
- Align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
